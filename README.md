# Synthetic-Forecast_Verification
A set of forecast verification routines to evaluate synthetic hydrologic ensemble forecasts against actual forecasts. This repository is aligned with the data generated from two synthetic forecasting approaches that are located in the following GitHub repos:   
Synthetic Forecast version 1 [https://github.com/zpb4/Synthetic-Forecast-v1-FIRO-DISES](https://github.com/zpb4/Synthetic-Forecast-v1-FIRO-DISES)   
Synthetic Forecast version 2 [https://github.com/zpb4/Synthetic-Forecast-v2-FIRO-DISES](https://github.com/zpb4/Synthetic-Forecast-v2-FIRO-DISES)   

Data generated from these algorithms for any of the available hindcast locations can be systematically compared via common ensemble verification techniques with the scripts contained in this repository. Importantly, synthetic forecasts should be viewed in the context of their ability to emulate the actual forecast metrics, not in relation to ideal forecast performance. In other words, an ideal synthetic forecast mimics the metric performance of the actual forecasts (HEFS in this case).   

To run these scripts, one must generate synthetic forecast samples from one or both of the referenced algorithms. R scripts in this repository extract data directly from R data structure (.rds) files generated by the main synthetic forecast script that are coded in R. To run the more detailed Python plotting routines, the synthetic and actual HEFS forecasts must be extracted from the R output in netCDF format. Generally speaking, synthetic forecast generations on the order of 10 samples are tractable for processing on a typical personal computing platform (e.g. PC or Mac). Larger samples will require a platform with sufficient RAM (i.e. HPC) to allow manipulation and plotting of the large data arrays. There are some scripts in the workflow that reduce larger samples to a smaller 10 sample chunks for visualization.
